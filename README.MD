### Prerequisites
Golang 1.18.2 or later<br/>
C compiler(gcc 4.9.0 or later, mingw etc.)<br/>

### Step

Build Node(default, join to the testnet)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/meverselabs/meverse
$ cd ./meverse/cmd/node
$ go build
$ ./node
```

Build Generator(required to create generator account for joining to the testnet as a observer)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/meverselabs/meverse
$ cd ./meverse/cmd/generator
$ go build
$ ./formulator
```

Build Observer(buildable, but cannot join to the testnet as a observer)

## Environment

### Command line and flags
Configuration and specification are continuously changing, and currently, all configurations are provided via configuration file.<br/>
When the changing possibility of configurations and command sets are reduced, command line and flags will be provided.<br/>

### System requirements

| Resource | Recommended | Minimum |
|:---------:|---------------|---------|
|CPU|6 core for 10,000 TPS|Minimum 2 core for 3,000 TPS|
|RAM|4 GB|Minimum 1 GB|
|Disk|16 GB|Minimum 4 GB|

All the requirements mentioned in this document are written based on MEVerseâ€™s full node. All requirements can be changed at the release stage.
Currently, we can achieve 7,000 TPS with 36 6-core servers in global regions, and now we are developing our system to achieve 20,000 TPS, which is the objective of the project.
##
### Configuration

In current stage, only the minimal configuration for the execution is being provided.<br/>
As the development is progressed, there can be additions/deletions/changes at any time.<br/>
Please see the details in related repositories.
